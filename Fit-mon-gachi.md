# Pokemon meets Tamagachi meets FitBit

### 1. Synopsis

    Combining the technology of a fitness tracker with the 1996 toy craze 'Tamagachi', we 
    introduce a new incentive to get you outside! Introducing "INSERT APP NAME HERE"! This 
    app leverages the data gathered from your fitness tracker, and allows you to take care 
    of your 'Tamagachi-like' avatar! The more data your fitness tracker obtains, the more fun 
    your avatar becomes! 
    
    For example: Steps help contribute to the experience gained which ultimately levels up 
    your avatar. The higher your avatar's level is, the more activities and interaction with 
    your avatar becomes unlocked. After the user becomes comfortable enough with the app,
    they'll be able to test their avatar's power with other users! The first user to knock 
    their opponent's avatar HP to 0 will be crowned victorious. If you win, you'll be rewarded
    points on the online leaderboard. Who will remain victorious? 

    If you lose, there's no shame. Spend more time training your avatar by leveraging your 
    fitness tracker! Some of the sample *stat calculations are as follows: 

        1. HP is the total health of your avatar. HP is increased based on the achieving your 
        active mins a day goal.  
        2. Attack increases the amount of damage you cause each turn. Increase this stat by 

        3. Speed increases to dodge your opponents attacks in battle. Increase this stat by
        maintaining your optimal heart rate. 
    
    ... and many more stats based on your activities! If you choose to stop playing, your avatar 
    will no longer receive the nourishments it needs to live, and will die. Ultimately resetting 
    the progress you've made on your avatar back to the default values. Whether you're a fitness 
    guru, or a couch potato.... "INSERT APP NAME HERE" is bringing life to a rather lifeless 
    device! Fun for all ages!
   
**Stat calculations may change based on data from API*
