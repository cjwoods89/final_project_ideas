# Pokemon meets Tamagachi meets FitBit

### 1. Synopsis

    Combining the technology of a fitness tracker with the 1996 toy craze 'Tamagachi', we 
    introduce a new incentive to get you outside! Introducing "INSERT APP NAME HERE"! This 
    app leverages the data gathered from your fitness tracker, and allows you to take care 
    of your 'Tamagachi-like' avatar! The more data your fitness tracker obtains, the stronger 
    your avatar becomes! For example: Steps help contribute to the experienced gained which 
    ultimately levels up your avatar, HP is increased based on the average duration of daily 
    physical activity, Speed is increased based on the duration of optimal heart rate, and 
    many more stats based on your activities! Test your avatars skills against others, and 
    see who can be the strongest! "INSERT APP NAME HERE" is bringing life to a rather lifeless 
    device!

### 2. Monetization

    1. An avatar is provided based on starting values. Additional avatars can be unlocked 
    or purchased through the store app.
    2. Additional cosmetics for your avatar (hats, outfits, wigs, etc...) can be purchased 
    for aesthetic purposes.
    3. Stat boosters can be purchased to help speed up the avatar strengthening process. 
    (Pay to win).
