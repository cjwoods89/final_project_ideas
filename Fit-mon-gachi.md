# Pokemon meets Tamagachi meets FitBit

### 1. Synopsis

    Combining the technology of a fitness tracker with the 1996 toy craze 'Tamagachi', we introduce a new incentive to get you outside! Introducing "INSERT APP NAME HERE"! This app leverages the data gathered from your fitness tracker, and allows you to take care of your 'Tamagachi-like' avatar! The more data your fitness tracker obtains, the stronger your avatar becomes! For example: Steps help contribute to the experienced gained which ultimately levels up your avatar, HP is increased based on the average duration of daily physical activity, Speed is increased based on the duration of optimal heart rate, and many more stats based on your activities! Test your avatars skills against others, and see who can be the strongest! "INSERT APP NAME HERE" is bringing life to a rather lifeless device!

### 2. Monetization

    1. An avatar is provided based on starting values. Additional avatars can be unlocked or purchased through the store app.
    2. Additional cosmetics for your avatar (hats, outfits, wigs, etc...) can be purchased for aesthetic purposes.
    3. Stat boosters can be purchased to help speed up the avatar strengthening process. (Pay to win).
