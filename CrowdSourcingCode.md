# Crowd Sourcing for Coding Projects

### 1. Synopsis

    You have just obtained your technology degree, or received certification from completing 
    a Coding Bootcamp, and are now ready to get out into the workforce. There's only one 
    problem..... Most big tech companies are looking for experienced developers. Your Coding 
    Bootcamp and degree provided you with ample resources to showcase your skills, but most 
    developers are looking for practical real-world experience. How do you gain said experience 
    if employers aren't hiring non-experienced developers? Introducing "INSERT APP NAME HERE"! 
    "INSERT APP NAME HERE" takes the best of social media, crowd sourcing and mixes in portfolio 
    & project management. Users of the app will be able to do any of the following:

        1. Explore a marketplace of coding projects soliciting developer(s).
        2. Add new projects, existing projects, or conceptual ideas to the marketplace of their own. 
        3. Build out their developer profile containing a portfolio of associated projects. 
        4. Parter with senior developers to develop a mentorship using social media aspects. 
        4. Provide the experience, exposure, and core skills to the developer which companies crave.

    "INSERT APP NAME HERE" is designed by and for developers, regardless of tenure in the role.
    Our objective is to helps get things done, build the experience companies want, builds 
    confidence in the next generation of developers, and have a little fun while we're at it!

### 2. Monetization

    1. Projects can range from free services, to paid application development. "INSERT APP NAME 
    HERE" will receive a % of the profits earned using our platform. 
    2. Integrate with first & third party recruiting companies which provides a comprehensive 
    view of any user's portfolio and submit job requisitions directly to the user. "INSERT APP 
    NAME HERE" may collect a Finders Fee for using our platform for solicitation.
    3. Partner with Coding Bootcamp and technology courses to integrate our post-graduation 
    services which can increase their post-graduation employment rates.
    4. Partner with businesses to solicit developers for lower priority projects they do not 
    have the internal resources for.
