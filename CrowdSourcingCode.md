    from completing a Coding Bootcamp, and are now ready to get out into 
    the workforce. There's only one problem..... Most companies are looking 
    for experienced developers. Your Coding Bootcamp did provide you with 
    ample resources to showcase your skills, but most developers are looking

    won't hire you? Introducing "INSERT APP NAME HERE"! "INSERT APP NAME
