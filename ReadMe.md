## Pokemon meets Tamagachi meets FitBit

### 1. Synopsis

* App that leverages the data from FitBit to grow the strength of your monster. You can use the monster to battle others digitally through the website or the app.

* You start with a wimpy creature, who grows their various stats based on the data that comes back from your FitBit. For example, the number of steps you take using the Fitness Tracker would increase the level of your creature. Each level of your creature increases the maximum for each stat. 

* Steps can be turned into some type of currency, which can be used to interact with your creature in a variety of ways. This can also allow for monetization and modify the avatar’s cosmetics (add a hat…. Outfit… color… or change the avatar entirely). 

* Stats are increased in a variety of ways:
Speed is increased based on the duration of optimal heart rate
HP is increased based on the average duration of physical activity daily
etc… etc…
